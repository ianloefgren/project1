CSCI 2270 Final Project

Member(s): Ian Loefgren

Project: This project will be a C++ implementation of a basic neural network that can be trained to recognize handwritten digits. After training, the net will be able to identify an input image as a particular digit. Handwritten digits will be what the net is taught to identify because there is a large database of these training images available. A neural network is, at its core, a graph, with input and output nodes, with a function to determine the weight of an input and compare that weight to the weight necessary to activate the the connected node.
